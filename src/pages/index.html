        <h5><a href="">www.skybojapan.com</a></h5>
        <p>Skybo Japan needed a bi-lingual website quickly. They also wanted a refresh of their corporate ID. We designed a new logo and colour scheme to be used in a responsive website. One interesting feature is on the contact page. They needed a way for people to “build a trip”. We used Angular JS to create the trip builder. We used WordPress for the CMS and all fields are editable right down to the button labels in both English and Japanese. We were able to go from start to completed build in just under two weeks.</p>
